# Django-Applications
Contains django related codes and applications.

"Django-Applications/djangowebsite" file is an example of Django home page application.
It has home app that contains "templates" folder. This folder should be created by just by hand or mkdir command.
"templates" folder (Django-Applications/djangowebsite/home/templates/) contains "home.html" file, and our home page html code is inside of this file.

This html file (Django-Applications/djangowebsite/home/templates/home.html) also contains "iframe" code blok which is a Kibana graph source code obtained by Kibana.
When you run Kibana and Elasticsearch servers and take Kibana source code from share link and paste it to instead of my "iframe" kode, you will see the your Kibana graph image.
